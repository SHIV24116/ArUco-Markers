# ArUco-Markers

# ArUco Marker Generation & Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating how to *generate* and *detect* ArUco markers using *OpenCV*.  
ArUco markers are widely used in *robotics, **computer vision, and **augmented reality* for tasks such as *object tracking, **pose estimation, and **drone or robot localization*.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Generate ArUco markers of custom IDs (0â€“49)  
- âœ… Automatically display and save the marker as an image  
- âœ… Detect markers in real-time using *OpenCV + IP Webcam feed*  
- âœ… Display detected marker IDs and coordinates on-screen  
- âœ… Draw bounding boxes and center points for each detected marker  
- âœ… Print detection info (ID & coordinates) in the console

## âš™ Installation & Requirements

Before running the scripts, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
